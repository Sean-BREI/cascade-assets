# Cascade Code

The purpose of this folder is to contain code from Cascade that needs to be reviewed by the Dev Team, since there isn't a way to do it inside Cascade. The folder structure should mimic the setup in Cascade CMS. If the folder you're working in from Cascade is not here already, add it.
