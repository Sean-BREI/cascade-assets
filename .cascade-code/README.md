# Cascade Code

The purpose of this folder is to contain code from Cascade that needs to be reviewed by the Dev Team, since there isn't a way to do it inside Cascade. Create a new folder for your branch in this folder, commit your changes, and issue a pull request, even if you don't plan on merging. The folder structure should mimic the setup in Cascade CMS.
