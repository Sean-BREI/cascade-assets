        <p>The master of science in athletic training prepares students for a career as a certified athletic trainer. Athletic trainers (ATs) are health care professionals who collaborate with physicians to optimize activity and participation of patients and clients. The services provided by ATs comprise prevention, diagnosis and intervention of emergency, acute and chronic medical conditions involving impairment, functional limitations and disabilities. Athletic training is recognized by the American Medical Association as a healthcare profession. The master of science in athletic training (MS.AT) will begin in summer 2015 and will be a full-time, cohort-model program.&nbsp;</p>

          Two sample iframe embeds. One YouTube, the other the civic engagment widget.
          A JS function will wrap these in div.video tags. YouTube embeds require special
          styling to deal with margin/padding issues. Others probably don't.

              This builds an iframe. It is being added to
              /students/life/civic-engagement/programs/cubooths.

              There was an issue where it was being displayed with a large unsightly bottom border.

        <p><b>As a cohort-model program, admission into the MS.AT program is highly competitive and limited.</b></p>
        <p>This full-time, intensive program is a rich combination of didactic, hands-on clinical laboratories, and clinical fieldwork providing carefully guided clinical experiences every semester. Clinical fieldwork placements include a variety of colleges, universities, high schools and physician offices.</p>
