Why would I do it after? Huh, what you think I'm afraid of you? I'm not afraid of you. It's my term for my time of the month. Oh. What time of the month? The weekend? Shut up, do what I tell you, I'm not interested; these are just some of the things you'll be hearing if you answer this ad. I'm an idiot and I dont care about anyone but myself. P.S. No dogs!

A story of a young man trying to find his sexuality in the uncaring Thatcher years. Warning: Contains scenes of graphic homoeroticism. Oh my God. I didn't even know Smarties made a cereal. They don't. It's just Smarties in a bowl with milk. Nicer ambulances, faster response times and better looking drivers mean they're not just the Emergency Services, they're your Emergency Services. It's like they're pally-wally with us when there's a problem with their printer, but once it's fixed... No, that's the music you hear when... I'm sorry are you from the past?</p>
